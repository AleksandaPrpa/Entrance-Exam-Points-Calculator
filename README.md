Entrance Exam Points Calculator is a web application designed to help students in Serbia calculate their total admission score for university enrollment — based on high school grades and entrance exam performance.

This version of the calculator is tailored specifically for faculties that use a standardized entrance exam format consisting of 20 equally weighted tasks, for a total of 60 entrance exam points. Combined with high school grades (up to 40 points), students receive a final admission score out of 100.

Supported faculties include:

ETF – School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade

FON – Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade


These institutions typically follow the 20-task model, where each task is graded with whole numbers and contributes equally to the final entrance exam score.
